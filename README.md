## Architecture

### Generally

- storybook - in this folder there is all configuration for storybook. More information can you find in Storybook section.
- assets - in this folder there is all icons, images, fonts which are use for example for favicon in web version. All use you can find in app.json file.
- .env - There is file for environment variable 
- .eslint.rc, prettien - in this files there is all rules which are apply in this project
- src - this folder is the heart of the application. It consists of the:
    - components - For the folder structure I use (atomic design)[https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/]. In my opinion there is really good way to organize small and medium applications. We have a clear breakdown of our components. We create small/basic component and then we build bigger ones out of them until the moment we will come to page. This way resembles playing with Lego blocks. I tried to make that each folder will have the same structure: stories, styled, test, folder with components and index.ts. Unfortunately a lot of components haven't got a tests. I am going to add this in next iteration.
    - context - weatherContext - in weather context I fetch data from OpenWeather api. I use context for that because I would like to avoid `prop drilling` and now we can take data from anywhere place in the app.
